            <p>
                In the dimly lit observatory, Professor Hale stood beside the massive telescope, his eyes fixed on the
                night sky. He had always found comfort in the vast expanse of stars. Tonight, however, was different. He
                had something to share with his student, Liam—a discovery that would push their understanding of
                exoplanets.
                <br><br>
                Liam entered the room with an excited smile. “You called for me, Professor? What’s the big news?”
                <br><br>
                Professor Hale motioned to the chair beside him. “Take a seat, Liam. I think you’ll find this
                fascinating.”
                <br><br>
                Liam sat down, eager, and opened his notebook. “Is this about the new exoplanets you mentioned last
                week?”
                <br><br>
                “Exactly,” Hale replied, his tone serious. “We’ve been studying a very peculiar class of
                planets—Neptunian exoplanets. They’re planets that are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus in our solar
                system.”
                <br><br>
                Liam scribbled down some notes. “So, like gas giants?”
                <br><br>
                “Not exactly,” Hale said, leaning forward. “Neptunian planets are smaller than gas giants like Jupiter
                and Saturn, but they’re still much larger than Earth. They’re mostly composed of hydrogen and helium,
                with cores of rock and heavier metals. Think of Neptune—about four times the size of Earth and 17 times
                its mass.”
                <br><br>
                “Right,” Liam nodded, “I remember that. But what’s so special about these exoplanets?”
                <br><br>
                Hale smiled faintly. “What’s special is what we’ve been finding—and what we haven’t. We've discovered
                hot Jupiters—giant planets very close to their stars—and super-Earths—planets up to 1.5 times Earth's
                size. But there’s been a mystery surrounding what we call ‘hot Neptunes.’”
                <br><br>
                “Hot Neptunes?” Liam asked, raising an eyebrow.
                <br><br>
                “Yes,” Hale said. “These are Neptune-sized planets that orbit extremely close to their stars, much
                closer than Neptune does to our Sun. But here’s the strange part: they’re incredibly hard to find.”
                <br><br>
                Liam frowned. “Why is that?”
                <br><br>
                “That’s what we’re trying to figure out,” Hale said, his voice lowering. “We’ve found a few of them, but
                not nearly as many as we expected. We call it the ‘hot Neptune desert’—a region close to stars where we
                should find these planets, but instead, there’s a mysterious lack of them.”
                <br><br>
                “That’s strange,” Liam muttered. “Do you think they’re just… disappearing?”
                <br><br>
                Hale leaned back in his chair, nodding. “That’s exactly what we suspect. And recent discoveries are
                starting to confirm it. You see, some of these hot Neptunes might have been plentiful at one time, but
                many of them could be evaporating.”
                <br><br>
                Liam blinked in surprise. “Evaporating? Like, losing their atmospheres?”
                <br><br>
                Hale’s eyes lit up. “Yes! That’s the exciting part. A few years ago, astronomers using the Hubble Space
                Telescope discovered a warm Neptune, GJ 436b, that’s slowly losing its atmosphere. The intense radiation
                from its star heats up the atmosphere to the point where it escapes the planet’s gravity. Imagine a hot
                air balloon lifting off the ground—except here, it’s the planet’s gases escaping into space.”
                <br><br>
                “That’s incredible,” Liam whispered. “So, GJ 436b is losing its atmosphere?”
                <br><br>
                “Exactly,” Hale said. “But it gets even better. We recently found another exoplanet, GJ 3470b, which is
                losing its atmosphere at an even faster rate—about 100 times faster than GJ 436b.”
                <br><br>
                Liam stared at his professor in awe. “100 times faster? That’s insane! Why is that happening?”
                <br><br>
                “Several reasons,” Hale explained. “For one, GJ 3470b isn’t as dense as GJ 436b, so it can’t hold onto
                its atmosphere as tightly. But more importantly, the star that GJ 3470b orbits is much younger and more
                energetic—it’s only about 2 billion years old, compared to GJ 436b’s star, which is around 4 to 8
                billion years old. This younger star is bombarding the planet with more intense radiation.”
                <br><br>
                “So, GJ 3470b is just getting fried?” Liam asked.
                <br><br>
                Hale nodded. “In a way, yes. Both GJ 436b and GJ 3470b are very close to their stars—about 3.7 million
                miles away, which is only a tenth of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. That proximity means
                they’re constantly being hit with high levels of radiation.”
                <br><br>
                Liam shook his head, trying to wrap his mind around it. “So, what happens to these planets as they lose
                their atmospheres?”
                <br><br>
                Hale leaned forward again, his voice dropping. “This is where it gets really interesting. As they lose
                their atmospheres, we think these hot Neptunes might shrink over time—down to mini-Neptunes, or even
                super-Earths.”
                <br><br>
                Liam’s eyes widened. “Wait, so they’re literally transforming into different kinds of planets?”
                <br><br>
                “That’s the theory,” Hale said, his tone serious. “These planets may have started off larger, but over
                billions of years, as they lose their atmospheres, they could become smaller, rocky worlds—more like
                Earth, but much hotter.”
                <br><br>
                “Wow,” Liam whispered, his pen paused over his notebook. “That would explain why we don’t see many hot
                Neptunes. They’re changing into something else.”
                <br><br>
                “Exactly,” Hale said, his excitement building. “We think atmospheric evaporation is playing a key role
                in creating this hot Neptune desert. Planets like GJ 3470b could eventually shrink into mini-Neptunes or
                super-Earths over time.”
                <br><br>
                Liam was deep in thought. “How do we know they’re losing so much atmosphere? Can we actually see it
                happening?”
                <br><br>
                Hale smiled and pointed to his computer screen. “We can’t see the gases escaping directly, but we can
                detect them in other ways. Hubble’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph allowed us to detect the
                ultraviolet signature of hydrogen escaping from GJ 3470b. It forms a huge cocoon around the planet, and
                when the planet passes in front of its star, this hydrogen cloud filters some of the starlight. By
                analyzing that filtered light, we can estimate how much atmosphere is escaping.”
                <br><br>
                Liam sat back, impressed. “And you said GJ 3470b has already lost up to 35% of its atmosphere?”
                <br><br>
                Hale nodded. “That’s right. And hydrogen might not be the only thing escaping. We suspect that heavier
                elements, like carbon, could also be dragged out into space by the escaping hydrogen.”
                <br><br>
                Liam grinned. “This is incredible, Professor. So what’s next? Are we looking for more of these planets?”
                <br><br>
                “We’re trying,” Hale said, his smile fading slightly. “But it’s not easy. Hydrogen gas is hard to detect
                in planets that are more than 150 light-years away because it gets obscured by interstellar gas. GJ
                3470b is only 97 light-years away, which is why we can observe it.”
                <br><br>
                “So, we might be missing a lot of these planets simply because they’re too far away?” Liam asked.
                <br><br>
                Hale nodded. “Exactly. But there’s another option—helium. Helium can also escape from these planets, and
                it’s detectable in infrared light, which isn’t blocked by interstellar gas. With the James Webb Space
                Telescope, we’ll be able to search for helium escaping from smaller planets, even mini-Neptunes.”
                <br><br>
                Liam smiled. “That could expand the search a lot.”
                <br><br>
                “That’s the hope,” Hale said. “With Webb’s sensitivity, we might be able to study planets that are too
                far away for us to detect hydrogen. It could revolutionize how we study planetary evolution.”
                <br><br>
                Liam closed his notebook and looked up at the stars. “It’s amazing to think that these planets are out
                there, slowly changing over time, losing their atmospheres, transforming. It’s like watching the
                universe evolve.”
                <br><br>
                Hale smiled, watching his student as he absorbed the wonder of it all. “That’s what makes this work so
                exciting, Liam. We’re not just observing distant worlds—we’re uncovering the stories of their lives.”
